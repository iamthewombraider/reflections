what happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?
so i can save commits to the repository and have multiple versions of my files

how is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? what value do you think it offers?
it seperates files you want to track from other files in the directoy that you may not want to track. it allows you to group files together logically. It makes things more efficient and easier to find supporting files.
